### Sprint 2 (starting 21st June)

I have decided to move on to sprint 2 slightly earlier than anticipated (original plan in the proposal was to start sprint 2 on the 29th June). This is partly because I was able to start the project earlier than I planned but also because I have made good progress towards my objectives with the creation of a minimum viable product that would benefit from user feedback.

A summary of the user feedback can be found [here](../sprint1/journal.md#userFeedback1) at the end of sprint 1.


###### Goals

- Setup the preliminary folder structure, kanban board and project journal. &#x2705;
- Initialise a local project Git repository and remote repository on Github. &#x2705;
- Ensure all initial tools and programming languages required to get the project started are ready and installed, including:
  * [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (and setting up a virtual environment). &#x2705;

  * [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#installation). &#x2705;

  * Javascript (specifically [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)). &#x2705;

  * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). &#x2705;

The full installation list will be kept up to date in the accompanying [code documentation](../documentation.md#installs).



##### Ongoing objectives

* Add more graphs. I think line graph would be a good next one to look at as it will be quite different to bar charts. Pie-charts I think will be quite similar to bar-charts as it is mostly categorical data and aggregations, only the presentation is different.
* To carry out unit testing of the bar-chart, statistics page and dashboard pages.
