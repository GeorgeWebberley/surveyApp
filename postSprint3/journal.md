### Post Sprint 3 (starting 6th July)

Whilst the majority of my development has now finished, I will be keeping this part of the journal going so that I can log any final changes I make to the application as user feedback continues to come back in. I will also use it to write about any difficulties/important things to mention as I am writing my dissertation up.

###### Goals
The main goals of this phase are to finalise the application with any last changes as user feedback comes back in and also to write the dissertation up.

More specifically, this will involve:

- Review user feedback as it returns.
- Do part of the dissertation write up soon so that I have something to send David Bernhard at out next supervisor meeting, as it will be our last before the deadline (approx. 1-2 weeks time).
- Bug fixing the code.
- Finishing the dissertation write up with time to spare (so not left until the last minute!)

The deadline for the dissertation is the 14th of September. Ideally I would like to aim to be finished at least a week before this date.

### Export all data (6th July)
As mentioned at the end of the [last sprint](../sprint3/journal.md#endSprint3), one user comment from a friend was that it would be useful to have a feature where you can export the entire survey into Excel, including the statistical tests and the graphs. I have implemented this now with the help of XlsxWriter again, and have refactored my code, that is already used for exporting statistical tests, so that it can be used in both routes. I have included a link for this feature on the home page. The survey is exported to one sheet, the statistical tests to a second sheet and the images of the graphs to a third sheet.

Tomorrow I will continue to work on the dissertation write up.


##### Ongoing objectives

* Full package export with tests, graphs and full data set.
* Start preparing for writing up dissertation.
* To carry out unit testing graph saving and manual data input pages.
* Refactoring code.
