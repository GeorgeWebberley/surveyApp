### Post Sprint 3 (starting 6th July)

Whilst the majority of my development has now finished, I will be keeping this part of the journal going so that I can log any final changes I make to the application as user feedback continues to come back in. I will also use it to write about any difficulties/important things to mention as I am writing my dissertation up.

###### Goals
The main goals of this phase are to finalise the application with any last changes as user feedback comes back in and also to write the dissertation up.

More specifically, this will involve:

- Review user feedback as it returns.
- Do part of the dissertation write up soon so that I have something to send David Bernhard at out next supervisor meeting, as it will be our last before the deadline (approx. 1-2 weeks time).
- Bug fixing the code.
- Finishing the dissertation write up with time to spare (so not left until the last minute!)

The deadline for the dissertation is the 14th of September. Ideally I would like to aim to be finished at least a week before this date.
